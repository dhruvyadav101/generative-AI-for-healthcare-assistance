# skin-disease-detection

This project is about training and comparing deep learning models for precise classification of
skin disease from image data. Four commonly used convolutional neural network models—
Efficient Net, MobileNet, Dense Net, and ResNet-50—were trained and validated to compare
their performance. In addition to the above, a maximum confidence ensemble model was
deployed to further increase prediction accuracy. Experimental outcomes indicated that each of
the individual models attained very high training accuracies (more than 96%), yet testing
accuracies were between 85% and 88%. The ensemble model was better than each of the
individual models with a testing accuracy of 90.74%, illustrating enhanced generalization and
resilience.
In addition to disease detection, the system also generates informative descriptions about the
predicted disease, including its symptoms, causes, and possible treatments. This integration of
generative AI aims to assist users by not only identifying the condition but also providing
relevant medical information for better awareness and early intervention. The findings highlight
the potential of combining classification models with information generation to build an
intelligent, user-friendly healthcare assistance tool.
